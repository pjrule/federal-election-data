The following is a list of the abbreviations used in this publication
to identify the party labels that appeared on the various state
ballots for the Presidential, Senate and House candidates in the
1996 primary and general elections. The designation of a party
label by a candidate may vary from state to state due to differences
in state law. The party label listed may not necessarily represent
a political party organization.
